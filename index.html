<h1>Take Care of Your Blanket - Native American Blankets</h1>

<div class="container">
<p>Your beautiful wool blanket is a sound investment – it's not only beautiful and wonderfully warm; When you take care of it, it will last a lifetime. Whether you have a blanket for your sofa, a <a href="https://geembi.com/collections/cultures/native-american/">Native American blankets</a> for your bed or wall, or even a saddle blanket for your horse, there's no better product on the market. compared to an authentic blanket made by geembi.</p>
<p>In order for your blanket to last and look great, you need to understand some basic care principles...</p>
<h2>Basics of wool</h2>
<p>Wool is a natural, durable fiber and a great choice for blankets and clothing. It is one of the best fibers for warmth, comfort and durability.</p>
<p>Wool is literally wool or fur. Made of keratin, like human hair, it is naturally curled and its fibers overlap, expanding and contracting to create an elastic material that offers comfort and resilience. These fibers are also covered with a thin film of waxy material that prevents rain but absorbs sweat. Wool is porous and holds air at 80% of its volume; As such, it is an excellent insulator and keeps you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>
<p>Your blanket has been made from wool that has never been used before – so its quality is not compromised by using recycled goods.</p>
<p>Wool is natural:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable</li>
<li>Elastic</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Waterproof</li>
<li>Fire protection</li>
<li>Durable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintain your Blanket</h2>
<p>Hang your blanket to restore smoothness and eliminate wrinkles.</p>
<p>Wipe spills off your blanket as soon as possible and ventilate regularly.</p>
<p>When it comes to cleaning your wool blanket, professional dry cleaning service by a reputable supplier is the best option. Washing your blanket, even if done properly according to care instructions labels, will cause some parts of the blanket to shrink. When washing, the blanket will also lose some of its soft and smooth aesthetic and become harder and coarser. Unless your blanket tag stipulates it's washable, dry cleaning is by far your best bet.</p>
<h2>Prevent damage from moths</h2>
<p>Termites can occur when your blanket is stored or not in use. Clothing moths prefer dark places to lay eggs and the larvae feed on wool. Prevent damage to your wool blanket by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean blankets before storing them</li>
<li>Brush the blanket regularly with a lint brush</li>
<li>Store your wool blanket in an airtight bag or box</li>
</ul>
<p>While mothballs and camphor are very effective at repelling moths, herbal and cedar moth repellant products are not particularly effective.</p>
